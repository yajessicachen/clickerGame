# Clicker Game

Our Cookie Clicker clone will be coffee-themed. The player will click a giant Coffee emoji, incrementing a counter showing the quantity of coffee they currently possess. Coffee can be spent to purchase coffee-producing devices, such as percolators and espresso machines. Every second, the player will passively accumulate coffee proportionate to the number and kind of coffee-producing devices they've purchased.

Importantly, the price (in coffee) of each producer will increase according to the number already in the player's possession. This is what enables the game to remain interesting even after coffee production has been automated: the player has to make decisions about which purchases make the best use of their coffee depending on the current price of each producer. Check out the demo below or try out Cookie Clicker if what we're talking about here isn't clear.

In addition to a coffee counter, the player will be able to see how many of each producer they possess, the current price of each producer, the CPS (coffee per second) of each producer, and the total CPS for all producers, combined. Finally, to make things more interesting, we won't show all of the producers at the start of the game. The producers will be unlocked successively as the player accumulates more coffee.
